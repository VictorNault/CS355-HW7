Features/EC Summary:

    Disk format:

    Our disk is formatted in the following way: superblock -> fat table -> data blocks
    
    The superblock takes up one block, and contains:
     the size of each block (512 bytes),
     the block offset of the fat table (always 1), 
     the block offset of the data region (always 17),
     the fat index of the head of the free block list (can change, but on a freshly formatted disk is 1),
     and padding so that the struct is block sized
